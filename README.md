# Student Marks Prediction
## Description
This project is a web-based application that predicts student marks based on the number of study hours using a Linear Regression model. The model is built with Python and Scikit-learn, and the web interface is developed using the Flask framework.

This tool allows users to input the number of hours a student studies and receive a predicted score based on the trained model.
## Features
- Predicts student marks using Linear Regression.
- Simple web interface using Flask.
- Easy to use with real-time prediction.
##   Technologies Used
 - Python: Core programming language.
- Flask: Web framework for building the application.
- Scikit-learn: Used for building and training the linear regression model.
- HTML/CSS: For front-end design.
- Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
## Project Structure

The following is the structure of the project:

student_marks_prediction/ │ 
├── app1.py # Main Flask application entry point 
├── linear_reg.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook for Linear Regression model development 
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
├── student_info.csv # Dataset containing student information 
├── student_marks_predictor.pkl # Serialized Linear Regression model file
├── smp_data_from_app.log # Log file for the application
├── templates/ # Folder for HTML templates │ └── index.html # Main HTML page for user input and prediction display 
└── static/ # Folder for static assets like images └── images/ # Image assets used in the web application

### Explanation of the Project Files:

- **`app1.py`**: This is the main file that contains your Flask application and handles the routing and logic for student marks prediction.
- **`linear_reg.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook where you develop and train your Linear Regression model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file that lists all the dependencies and packages required for your project.
- **`student_info.csv`**: The dataset used for training or testing the model, containing information about students and their study hours/marks.
- **`student_marks_predictor.pkl`**: A serialized version of the trained Linear Regression model, saved for later use in predictions.
- **`smp_data_from_app.log`**: A log file generated by your application to track events, errors, or actions within the app.
- **`templates/index.html`**: The HTML template that is rendered in the browser, where users can input the study hours and get predictions.
- **`static/images/`**: This directory holds static assets like images used in the application’s frontend.
## Installation
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
### Steps
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Arup-Gharami/student_marks_prediction_linear_regression.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd student-marks-prediction(your folder name)
3. Create a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
venv\Scripts\activate

5. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Model Training
 - open linear_reg.ipynb in jupyter notebook run all cells
 - its create student_mark_predictor.pkl file

## Running the Application
1. Run the Flask web application using app.py:
python app1.py

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:5000

3. You will see a form where you can input the number of study hours. The application will return the predicted marks.

## Example
- Input: 5 hours of study per day
- Prediction: 70.1 % marks
